# micro.pulsing.dots

This is a backlight program that uses the CharliePlex'd 16x9 LED array and driver chip all from Adafruit.  It can also use the LIS3DH accelerometer to move the dots about.  This backlight program simulates the uneven backlighting I was creating for my photo-jars, except these are dynamic dots that undulate, etc...
